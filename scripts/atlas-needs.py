"""atlas-needs — tell THIS seat what the estate has addressed to it (method 1.27.2).

A seat's briefing renders needs addressed to it from inside its own vault. A need filed
in ANOTHER vault is correctly placed (one home, the author's outbox) and is EXTERNAL
to the seat that owes it: the in-vault briefing cannot render it — a location fact, not a
read receipt (the method has no notion of "seen"). Measured 2026-09-13: 58 of 78 open needs
estate-wide
(ansible-platform finding; tool designed and first deployed by the orchestrator, adopted
here). This reads the estate's needs register, filters to this seat, and keeps a local
file the briefing and the Stop guard read.

  --refresh   fetch the register, write ~/.atlas/needs-open.md   (the ESTATE schedules this)
  --show      exit 2 with a short message IF the file changed     (Stop guard, every turn)
  (no flag)   print the file                                       (by hand)

Split on purpose: --refresh touches the network; --show never does (two stats). A seat
persists for days, so SessionStart is too rare to rely on — the briefing carries the
file at start/compaction, and --show surfaces CHANGES at turn end.

NEVER WAKES A SEAT. --refresh writes a file. --show speaks only inside a turn the seat is
already taking, as a Stop block (exit 2) — the only way a Stop hook reaches the model;
an exit-0 print never reaches it. Told once per change, not every turn.

INERT WITHOUT A REGISTER. ATLAS_NEEDS_REGISTER unset (a single-vault project) → does
nothing. Cross-vault needs only exist at estate scale, where the orchestrator publishes
the register (method §10, registries) and every seat holds the vault-read token.
